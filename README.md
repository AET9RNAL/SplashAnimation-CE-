This is a fork, original mod can be found here: [**Click**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/splashanimation)

When i was developing my modpack I needed an intro in the beginning, so I found this mod. After some testing and messing around I couldn't get it to show more than ~180 frames, it would just fade out no matter what I tweaked. So, I came up with this thing, that fixes the thing, at the expense of another thing 0\_0. What changed?

Pros: Animation time increased(tested up to 600 frames).

Cons: Frame time can no longer be adjusted, the framerate is fixed

SplashAnimation is a lightweight utility mod that lets you play a custom animation right at the start of the game, smoothly transitioning into the loading screen.

Features:

1.  Displays an animation as the game begins to load
    
2.  Doesn’t impact loading speed — and can even make it feel faster by keeping users entertained
    
3.  Offers config options to fit your modpack
    

Usage : It's recommended to follow the tutorial to get started

Add your animation frames as images: animation/000.png, animation/001.png, and so on, depending on how many frames you need

Customize the behavior by editing config/splashanimation.cfg

That’s it — launch the game and enjoy!

The fork was originally designed for use with the [NewDawn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nd-new-dawn) modpack.
